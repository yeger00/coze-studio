Thanks,



[Coze Studio](https://www.coze.cn/home) is an all-in-one AI agent development tool. Providing the latest large models and tools, various development modes and frameworks, Coze Studio offers the most convenient AI agent development environment, from development to deployment. 

* **Provides all core technologies needed for AI agent development**: prompt, RAG, plugin, workflow, enabling developers to focus on creating the core value of AI.
* **Ready to use for professional AI agent development at the lowest cost**: Coze Studio provides developers with complete app templates and build frameworks, allowing you to quickly construct various AI agents and turn creative ideas into reality.

Coze Studio, derived from the "Coze Development Platform" which has served tens of thousands of enterprises and millions of developers, we have made its core engine completely open. It is a one-stop visual development tool for AI Agents that makes creating, debugging, and deploying AI Agents unprecedentedly simple. Through Coze Studio's visual design and build tools, developers can quickly create and debug agents, apps, and workflows using no-code or low-code approaches, enabling powerful AI app development and more customized business logic. It's an ideal choice for building low-code AI products tailored . Coze Studio aims to lower the threshold for AI agent development and application, encouraging community co-construction and sharing for deeper exploration and practice in the AI field.

The backend of Coze Studio is developed using Golang, the frontend uses React + TypeScript, and the overall architecture is based on microservices and built following domain-driven design (DDD) principles. Provide developers with a high-performance, highly scalable, and easy-to-customize underlying framework to help them address complex business needs.

## Quickstart
Learn how to obtain and deploy the open-source version of Coze Studio, quickly build projects, and experience Coze Studio's open-source version.
> Detailed steps and deployment requirements can be found in [Quickstart](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/2.-Quickstart).

Environment requirements:

* Before installing Coze Studio, please ensure that your machine meets the following minimum system requirements: 2 Core、4 GB
* Pre-install Docker and Docker Compose, and start the Docker service.

Deployment steps:

1. Retrieve the source code.
   ```Bash
   # Clone code
   git clone https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio.git
   ```

2. Configure the model.
   1. Copy the template files of the doubao-seed-1.6 model from the template directory and paste them into the configuration file directory.
      ```Bash
      cd coze-studio
      # Copy model configuration template
      cp backend/conf/model/template/model_template_ark_doubao-seed-1.6.yaml backend/conf/model/ark_doubao-seed-1.6.yaml
      ```

   2. Modify the template file in the configuration file directory.
      1. Enter the directory `backend/conf/model`. Open the file `ark_doubao-seed-1.6.yaml`.
      2. Set the fields `id`, `meta.conn_config.api_key`, `meta.conn_config.model`, and save the file.
         * **id**: The model ID in Coze Studio, defined by the developers themselves, must be a non-zero integer and globally unique. Do not modify the model ID after the model goes online.
         * **meta.conn_config.api_key**: The API Key for the model service, which in this example is the API Key for Volcengine Ark. Refer to [Retrieve Volcengine Ark API Key](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1541594) for the acquisition method.
         * **meta.conn_config.model**: The model ID of the model service, which in this example is the Endpoint ID of the Volcengine Ark doubao-seed-1.6 model access point. For retrieval methods, refer to [Retrieve Endpoint ID](https://www.volcengine.com/docs/82379/1099522).
3. Deploy and start the service.
   When deploying and starting Coze Studio for the first time, it may take a while to retrieve images and build local images. Please be patient. During deployment, you will see the following log information. If you see the message "Container coze-server Started," it means the Coze Studio service has started successfully.
   ```Bash
   # Start the service
   cd docker
   cp .env.example .env
   docker compose --profile "*" up -d
   ```
   After the service starts, it is normal for the `coze-minio-setup` , `coze-mysql-setup-init-sql` , and `coze-mysql-setup-schema` containers to be in an exited state (exit 0). For common startup failure issues, **please refer to the [FAQ](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/9.-FAQ)**.
4. After starting the service, you can open Coze Studio by accessing `http://localhost:8888/` through your browser.


## Developer Guide

* **Project Configuration**:
   * [Model Configuration](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/3.-Model-configuration): Before deploying the open-source version of Coze Studio, you must configure the model service. Otherwise, you cannot select models when building agents, workflows, and apps.
   * [Plugin Configuration](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/4.-Plugin-Configuration): To use official plugins from the plugin store, you must first configure the plugins and add the authentication keys for third-party services.
   * [Basic Component Configuration](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/5.-Basic-component-configuration): Learn how to configure components such as image uploaders to use functions like image uploading in Coze Studio .
* [API Reference](https://github.com/coze-dev/coze-studio/wiki/6.-API-Reference): The Coze Studio Community Edition API and Chat SDK are authenticated using Personal Access Token, providing APIs for conversations and workflows.
